# Turbin3 Q3 cohort builder projects 

# 1.  [ Q3-25 Enrollment](https://github.com/tenrikut/Q3_2025_Builders_Qualifier)
### üìÅ `airdrop-ts/` - TypeScript Implementation

A comprehensive TypeScript project using `@solana/web3.js` and `@coral-xyz/anchor` for Solana blockchain interactions.

### üìÅ `rs/` - Rust Implementation

A Rust implementation using native Solana SDK libraries for blockchain operations.
# 2. [Q3-25-solana-starter ](https://github.com/tenrikut/Q3-25-solana-starter)
This is a TypeScript-based starter project for creating, minting, and managing Solana SPL tokens and NFTs. The project demonstrates how to mint and transfer SPL tokens, upload NFT images and metadata to decentralized storage (Irys/IPFS/Pinata), and work with Metaplex metadata on Solana.

# 3. [ Q3-25-Anchor-Vault ](https://github.com/tenrikut/Q3-25-Anchor-Vault)
Solana vault program built with the Anchor framework.This program allows users to open a vault, manage SOL deposits and withdrawals, and close the vault to retrieve any rent held.

# 4. [Q3-25-Anchor-Escrow](https://github.com/tenrikut/Q3-25-Anchor-Escrow)
A Solana smart contract (program) for creating and managing token escrows, built with Anchor. This project demonstrates a minimal, production-ready escrow flow with full test coverage.
# 5. [Q3-25-Anchor-Amm] (https://github.com/tenrikut/Q3-25-Anchor-Amm)
This project implements a minimal yet robust AMM smart contract on Solana using the Anchor framework. It supports pool creation, liquidity provision, LP token minting, and slippage protection. The codebase is designed for extensibility and security, following best practices for Solana programs.
